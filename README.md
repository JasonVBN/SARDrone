# SARDrone

Autonomous Search-and-Rescue Drone: autonomously traverses a specified search area and pinpoints locations of any humans present.

Although we tested on a relatively small DJI Tello drone due to tight budget, we designed the system with scalability in mind. It could easily be scaled up to a larger drone with longer range, higher quality camera, and faster speed.

Techniques used: multithreading, object detection (OpenCV & MediaPipe)
